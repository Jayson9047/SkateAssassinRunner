Overview:

This asset contains only animation files.
No custom character models or original meshes are included in this pack.

A dummy character (Y-Bot) is included only in the demo scene for preview purposes.
Animations may not display correctly on this demo character.
To use these animations properly, you must retarget them to your own humanoid character inside Unity.



Note on animation orientation:  
When playing the animations with your character, you may notice a -90° offset on the X-axis rotation.  
To fix this issue, we recommend importing your character into Blender or another 3D software, then rotating it +90° on the X-axis before importing it into Unity.  
This will ensure the animations align correctly with your character.  



Demo Scene:

The included Y-Bot model is provided only for visualization inside the demo scene.
Animations may appear misaligned or distorted on this model, which is expected.
For proper results, please retarget all animations to your own humanoid character.


Notes:

All animations are Humanoid-rig compatible.
The demo scene is not intended for production use, it only demonstrates that animations are functional.
Please follow Unity’s Humanoid Retargeting workflow to map these animations onto your characters.
